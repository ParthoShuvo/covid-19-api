# COVID 19 API

The COVID 19 API is organized around REST. Provided API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, verbs. The api is driven by the **Covid 19 dataset** from [**Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases, provided by JHU CSSE**](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## Getting Started
For development, you will only need [Golang](https://golang.org/) installed on your environement. 
**Note:** This project is developed on *Golang version 1.13*

#### Golang installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in
`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Please install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if it's not already done with the following command.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

If everything when fine, you should run

    brew update
    brew install golang
    
    - Then add those lines to export the required variables
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go-workspace # don't forget to change your path correctly!
    export GOROOT=/usr/local/opt/go/libexec

    - Verifying the Go Installation
    go version

#### Golang installation on Linux

    wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    sha256sum go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz # verify the Go tarball
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz

    - Adjusting the Path Variable (appending the following line to the /etc/profile file (for a system-wide installation) or the $HOME/.profile file (for a current user installation))
    export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go  # don't forget to change your path correctly!

    - Save the file, and load the new PATH environment variable into the current shell session
    source ~/.profile

    - Verifying the Go Installation
    go version

#### Golang installation on Windows

Just go on [official Golang website](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.14.2.windows-amd64.msi) & grab the installer.

#### Postman Installation

Download from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for your platform and install it.

## Installation
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ParthoShuvo/covid-19-api.git
    $ cd covid-19-api
    $ export GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor
    $ export GO111MODULE=on
    $ go mod download
    $ go mod vendor
    $ go mod verify
```

## Download [Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
**open bash/zsh shell** 
```
    $ chmod +x covid-19-dataset.sh
    $ ./covid-19-dataset.sh
```

## Build And Run
**Note:** Please change server *bind-address* and *port* at **covid_19_api.json** file before run following.

#### Localhost
```
    $ go build
    $ ./covid-19-api
```

#### Docker
```
    $ docker build -f dev.Dockerfile -t covid-19-api .
    $ docker run -it --rm -p ${host_port}:${docker_port} covid-19-api
```

## Improvment
*Need to work on following to make code more idiomatic and clean*
- Apply [**Effective Go Rules**](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Efficient logging & error handling
- Dataset reading and searching performance 
- Rest API endpoints design improvement
- Follow [**Go in Practice**](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice)
